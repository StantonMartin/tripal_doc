Views (content listings)
===============================

Drupal Views is a module which allows administrators to create and/or customize existing content listings. In Drupal 8, the views module is part of core so you simply need to enable it to get this functionality. Developers can provide default views through extension modules which allows your content listings and searches to be both easily customizable and under version control.
