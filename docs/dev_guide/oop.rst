Object-Oriented Development
=============================

While object-oriented development may be initially daunting, it is now well established as a best practice. For a general overview of PHP best practices, read through `phptherightway.com <https://phptherightway.com/>`_. Additionally, Drupal lists a multitude of resources on their `Background to Custom Module Development documentation <https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/creating-custom-modules/getting-started-background-prerequisites-drupal-8>`_. From the Tripal perspective, it is important to note that Tripal 4 follows the `object-oriented design patterns laid out by Drupal <https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/creating-custom-modules/getting-started-background-prerequisites-drupal-8#s-object-oriented-programming>`_.
