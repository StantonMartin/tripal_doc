# Home of Tripal Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/tripaldoc/badge/?version=latest)](https://tripaldoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

This repository is the official home of [Tripal](https://tripal.info) documentation!  Here Tripal core developers and extension module creators can place documentation for using tripal.

The most recent version of this documentation can be viewed online at https://tripaldoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

**NOTE: This repository currently starts with Tripal 4.x documentation. For access to the Tripal 3 documentation, please look within the docs folder of the Tripal 3.x codebase or access it online at https://tripal.readthedocs.io/en/7.x-3.x/**

## Documentation Design

The plan for Tripal 4 documentation is to provide a single resource for Tripal Users and Developers. Rather then documenting Tripal with the assumption you know Drupal, we are going to teach both Drupal/Tripal and provide links to core Drupal documentation for more information. This should make the Tripal 4 documentation an easier resource for PIs to point new developers at.

Idealistic Overview:
1. Install Tripal
2. Building your site: creating vocabularies, configuring pages...
3. Guiding your users: creating content, searching...
4. Site Administration: Importing data, administering users...
5. Extending Tripal
6. Upgrading Tripal
7. How to Contibute (Tripal Community)

Please feel free to create new issues in this repository to provide feedback or suggestions for this design! Also, if there is anything in particular you would like documented which is not currently, please start an issue for it! This helps us be purposeful in our documentation and ensure we are meeting the needs of our community.
